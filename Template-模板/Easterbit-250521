8. Introduction to your project. (Please include a clear overview of what your project is and why this is something that you want to work on.)
I'm building an AI-powered search engine for Move code on Aptos (with multi-chain expansion planned) and passionate about making blockchain transparent and more secure.

9. What problem are you trying to solve, and why is it important?
Smart contract vulnerabilities, such as overflows or reentrancy bugs, pose significant risks to blockchain projects, 
leading to financial losses and eroded trust. Current tools, like blockchain explorers, only provide access to public code or 
bytecode, requiring manual decompilation and analysis, which is time-consuming and limited to individual contracts. 
This inefficiency hinders developers’ ability to audit, learn from, or verify code at scale. 
Solving this is crucial for enhancing blockchain security, enabling faster development, and ensuring safer dApps.

10. What is your proposed solution?
We are building a specialized AI-powered search engine that scans and indexes all Move-based smart contracts on the Aptos blockchain. 
The platform allows users to search for code patterns, functions, or vulnerabilities across the entire network. 
Future features include vectorization of code for semantic searches (e.g., “show functions with overflow”), 
tagging of potentially dangerous functions, and automated analysis to identify connections and risks. 
This will streamline auditing, enable code reuse, and support the creation of AI agents trained on contract data for advanced use cases.

11. Any competitions? (Does your project have direct competition or similar project on the market within or without apples ecosystem?)
The primary competitors are blockchain explorers, which provide access to public code or bytecode but lack advanced search capabilities. 
These tools require manual decompilation and analysis, limiting their scope to single contracts. 
Our solution stands out by offering network-wide search, AI-driven analysis, and future vectorized search capabilities, 
making it significantly more efficient and scalable for developers and auditors.

12. Why Aptos？
Aptos is an ideal fit due to its use of the Move programming language, which emphasizes security and scalability, 
aligning with our goal of enhancing transparency

18. Budget proposal with milestones (The grant amount is usually 10k~50k. Please set up your budget proposal with milestones and estimated completion time.)
Milestone 1: AI Search and Tagging (3-4 months, $25,000)
 - Invite 1 core developers
 - Complete scanning and indexing of all Move-based smart contracts on the Aptos blockchain.
 - Develop a basic search interface for querying contracts by function or keyword.
 - Implement AI-driven search with vectorization for semantic queries (e.g., “find functions with overflow”).
 - Tag potentially vulnerable functions and build a basic analysis dashboard.
Milestone 2: Automation and Community Integration (1-3 months, $10,000)
 - Develop automated analysis tools to identify code connections and risks.
 - Integrate community feedback features and open-source select backend components for Aptos community collaboration.

Development and infrastructure: $35,000
AI model training and data storage: $5,000
Testing and community engagement: $5,000
Unforeseen Expenses: $5,000

19. Does the core team need office space support from Aptos Space (HK)?
No (at this time, we can work remotely)
